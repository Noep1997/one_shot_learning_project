# Visual Object Recognition & One-Shot Learning Project

This repository contains all partaining to my computer vision project on visual object recognition and one-shot learning as part of Harvard's Neuro140 - Biological & Artificial Intelligence class. The project goes into experimentation with CNNs and transfer learning, and their applications to demonstrating one-shot learning through transfer learning with ImageNet pretrained models and Siamese Neural Networks.

This repository contains the following files:
- renaming_files.py -- This is a helper file I wrote for converting the Omniglot dataset to 1,623 classes folder (one per character) instead of 50 folders with 20 character classes in each.
- Neuro140_Final_Project_Philippe_Noel.ipng -- This file contains the whole implementation and thought process for the practical work. The file is heavily commented and organized in 7 stages so to be easy to follow and reproduce. In addition, here is the link to the Google Colab file, so it can be easily run and experimented with: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vUMHqLKXff3WA-9D5cIUALiI7quP_Y_H#scrollTo=YLVke5g-_c33&uniqifier=8
- Neuro140_Final_Project.pdf -- This file contains the report, which goes in more details on the analysis of the results, the motivation behind the project, and avenues for future work.

Multiple references and online tutorials were used in the making of this project. They were mainly used for inspiration and helper functions used in loading and displaying data, with the models and the implementations realized primarily by myself from the Keras documentation. The references and acknowledgements are listed in the relevant parts in the notebook file, but I nonetheless want to acknowledge Hvass-Labs (https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials) for his multiple helper functions without which this project would have been much harder to perform.

The following Google Drive links the Omniglot dataset, both in its original form and in the processed form with 1,623 folder classes (denested using the helper program):
